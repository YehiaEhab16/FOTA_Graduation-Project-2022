### 🌍 General Overview For the Project

**Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) is a Mobile Software Management (MSM) technology in which the operating firmware of a device is wirelessly upgraded and updated by its manufacturer.**

- Firmware runs in the background without any input from the user and is there to make sure the device's hardware runs properly. The process of downloading these updates wirelessly usually takes little time, depending on the connection speed and the size of the update. This saves businesses the time and money spent sending a technician to have each one of their cellular devices physically upgraded or updated.
- Bugfix allows manufacturers to repair faulty units and remotely update software updates. This method typically involves the consumer downloading and updating mobile device firmware through a manufacturer’s website or server. FOTA updates are generally accessible through the device menu or software or firmware update.
- Security updates are constantly being released by the manufacturers, which includes a list of all known vulnerabilities during the Data transfer process. All devices must be updated regularly to avoid potential exploitation.
