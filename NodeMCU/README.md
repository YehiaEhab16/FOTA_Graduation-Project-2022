## üåç Overview

- The Telematics unit is the bridge connecting between the server and the whole system allowing to send and receive multiple data through it.
- We use the Telematics unit to communicate mainly with two other units, the server and the gateway (STM32).
- We used ESP32 module as it has a Wi-Fi module which is easy to be established using a few lines of code through Arduino IDE which gives us access to multiple libraries and functions in the ESP32.
